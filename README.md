**üé® About The Project**

This project is a web-based digital kaleidoscope that generates complex, symmetrical art in real-time based on your mouse movements. It's built entirely with p5.js, a JavaScript library for creative coding. The goal was to create a simple, relaxing, and visually engaging creative tool that anyone can use right in their browser.

The core of the kaleidoscope works by taking the mouse input in one segment of the screen and then using translate, rotate, and scale transformations to mirror and repeat the drawing across multiple axes of symmetry.

**Features**

Real-time Drawing: Patterns are generated instantly as you move your mouse.

Adjustable Symmetry: Use the slider to change the number of reflection axes from 2 to 24.

Dynamic Coloring: The brush color slowly cycles through the hue spectrum, creating a rainbow effect.

Responsive Design: The canvas automatically adjusts to fit the size of your browser window.

Simple UI: Clean controls for adjusting symmetry and clearing the canvas.



**üöÄ How to Use**

Interacting with the kaleidoscope is easy:

Click and drag your mouse on the canvas to start drawing.

Use the Symmetry slider at the bottom to increase or decrease the complexity of the pattern.

Click the Clear button to wipe the canvas and start a new creation.
